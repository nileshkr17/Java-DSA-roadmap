# **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java: Linked Lists**

---

## **1. Simple Explanation**

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in memory at random locations and linked using pointers.

Each **node** contains:

* **Data**: The value it holds.
* **Next**: A reference to the next node (in **Singly Linked List**).
* **Prev**: A reference to the previous node (only in **Doubly Linked List**).

**Types of Linked Lists:**

* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Circular Linked List (Singly/Doubly)

---

## **2. Illustration & Memory Layout**

### **Singly Linked List**

```
[10|*] -> [20|*] -> [30|null]
```

### **Doubly Linked List**

```
null <- [10|*|*] <-> [20|*|*] <-> [30|*|null]
```

### **Memory Layout Diagram**

In memory, nodes are scattered but connected via references:

```
Heap Memory:
[Node@0x1]: data=10, next=0x4
[Node@0x4]: data=20, next=0x7
[Node@0x7]: data=30, next=null
```

## **3. Time & Space Complexities**

| Operation       | Singly LL | Doubly LL | ArrayList |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Insert at Head  | O(1)      | O(1)      | O(n)      |
| Insert at Tail  | O(n)      | O(1)\*    | O(1)\*\*  |
| Delete at Head  | O(1)      | O(1)      | O(n)      |
| Delete at Tail  | O(n)      | O(1)      | O(1)\*\*  |
| Search by Value | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(n)      |
| Access by Index | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(1)      |

\* if tail pointer is maintained.
\*\* amortized.

## **4. Java LinkedList Class Internals**

`java.util.LinkedList` is a **Doubly Linked List**.

### **Key Features:**

* Implements `Deque`, allowing both stack and queue operations.
* Stores elements in nodes with `prev`, `next`, and `item` fields.

### **Source Code Snippet:**

```java
private static class Node<E> {
    E item;
    Node<E> next;
    Node<E> prev;
    Node(Node<E> prev, E element, Node<E> next) {
        this.item = element;
        this.next = next;
        this.prev = prev;
    }
}
```

### **Common Operations:**

```java
list.add("data");       // Adds to the end
list.remove(1);          // Removes by index
list.get(0);             // Accesses element by index
```

### **Why Doubly Linked List?**

* Efficient bidirectional traversal.
* O(1) insertions/deletions from both ends.

---

## **5. Linked List Variants**

### **Circular Linked List**

Last node's next pointer points back to the head:

```
[10|*] -> [20|*] -> [30|*] -+
        ^------------------+
```

### **Linked List Using Array**

Simulate links using array indices:

```java
int[] data = {10, 20, 30};
int[] next = {1, 2, -1};
```

### **Linked List Using Stack**

Used for problems like reversing a linked list.
Push nodes onto a stack, then pop to reverse order.

### **Linked List Using Queue**

Useful for simulating streaming input or ordered processing (FIFO behavior).

---

## **6. Concurrency with Linked Lists**

### **ConcurrentLinkedQueue**

* Part of `java.util.concurrent`.
* Non-blocking, thread-safe implementation of a FIFO queue.
* Internally uses a lock-free **linked list**.

### **Use Cases:**

* Background task queues.
* Event processing in real-time systems.
