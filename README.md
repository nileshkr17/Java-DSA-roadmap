# 📅 Day 0: Java Setup Guide

Before diving into DSA, let’s get your system ready to code in Java!
 📘 `Java_Setup_Guide.md` (inside `Day0_Setup/`)
---

### 🔧 Step 1: Install Java JDK

Download and install Java from:

- **[Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)** (Recommended)
- or **[OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/)** (Free, open-source)

> 📌 Recommended version: **Java 17+**

Verify installation:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

---

### 🔧 Step 2: Install an IDE

Choose an Integrated Development Environment:

| IDE            | Why Use It                  | Download Link                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| IntelliJ IDEA  | Great for Java, smart suggestions | [Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)   |
| VS Code        | Lightweight + extensions    | [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)     |
| Eclipse        | Classic Java IDE            | [Download](https://www.eclipse.org/)           |

---

### 🧱 Step 3: Create Your First Java File

Using IntelliJ:

1. File → New Project → Java
2. Set SDK to your installed JDK
3. Create a class: `Main.java`
4. Run with `Shift + F10` or the green play button.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java setup successful!");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔍 Step 4: Optional – Run Java Without IDE

Compile:

```bash
javac Main.java
```

Run:

```bash
java Main
```
